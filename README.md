# Athora: SpaceF Strikes Back
A sequel game to the original Athora, now known as Athora: A New Boat.

Athora: SpaceF Strikes Back is a strategy based GUI game, developed by @nulfy and @notreallyaduck for SDD Term 2 Assignment.

# Story
The year is 2157, 20 years after the defeat of mastermind and billionaire Felon Muks, the notorious criminal who mutilated society and made Earth uninhabitable for human life. 

A new hope was struck for the world when the secret agent who destroyed Felon took over his empire and rescued the world, relocating humanity to the newly discovered planet KESUM-F.

However, something is off. People around the planet are mysteriously disappearing. Not only that, but a recent recon expedition conducted by your mining company spotted a laboratory operating in secret, resembling something familiar...

Unfortunately, no one but you seems to suspect anything...

You, a low level employee, have taken it upon yourself to sneak into the lab and figure out what the hell is going on.
